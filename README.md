This repository contains the files and code necessary to replicate the analyses presented in the manuscript '_Differential host responses within the upper respiratory tract and peripheral blood of children, adolescents, and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection_', which has been submitted to medRxiv as a preprint (_________________). 

The manuscript demonstrates that age is associated with distinct upper respiratory and peripheral blood transcriptional responses among children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, we found that among uninfected children and adolescents, young age was associated with upregulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses within the upper respiratory tract, suggesting they may be primed to respond to respiratory pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with broad induction of innate and adaptive responses in the URT across all pediatric age groups. Within the periphery, we observed strong interferon responses across all age groups, while upregulation of myeloid activation, inflammatory, and coagulation pathways was observed only in adults. The presence of systemic symptoms was associated with a blunted immune response in the upper respiratory tract, but upregulated immune responses in the periphery. Finally, we correlated URT and peripheral responses within each participant and found that more robust URT immune responses were correlated with decreased peripheral immune activation, suggesting that effective mucosal immune responses in the URT may promote local viral control and limit systemic immune activation and symptoms.

## Description

This repository contains the data files ([`Data_Files/`](Data_Files/)), scripts, and results for each of the RNA sequencing analyses presented in this manuscript. The overall objective of this manuscript was to evaluate associations between age and both local and systemic host responses to SARS-CoV-2. 

The raw RNA sequencing files and final gene count matrix (BRAVE_RNASeq_counts.csv) are publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus ([GSE231409](______________).
