This repository contains the files and code necessary to replicate the analyses presented in the manuscript '_Differential host responses within the upper respiratory tract and peripheral blood of children, adolescents, and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection_', which has been submitted to medRxiv as a preprint (_________________).

## Description

This repository contains the data files ([`Data_Files/`](Data_Files/)), scripts, and results for each of the RNA sequencing analyses presented in this manuscript. The overall objective of this manuscript was to evaluate associations between age and both local and systemic host responses to SARS-CoV-2. 

The raw RNA sequencing files ([GSE231409](______________________________)) are publicly available.
